# Vanilla Javascript Bingo Game 🕹🎰😅

These game is a player vs computer game. The aim of the game is to achieve the goal which is the dropdown before the bingo button. User can click the next button to get a random number between 1 to 100 and if number is in card user are allowed to select the button bu if random number is not in card user are not allowed. Computer automatically picks it's number by itself if it is in his card. Then can call a win if the card he got is  equal to the Goal. Hope you enjoy these game and keep coding daily.😄😏🎮
